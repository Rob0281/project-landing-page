# project-landing-page
This is the landing page project for The Odin Project
I followed the suggested page format while adding my own changes to make it
my own, ie. different font colors and pictures, as well as some format changes.

Below are the links that I used for images. As well as the page sections that I placed them.

All the images were from Pixaby.com
